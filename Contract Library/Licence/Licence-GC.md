### Article 1. Introduction

1.1. This "**FlexUp Licence**" sets out the terms and conditions governing the use of materials developed and owned by FlexUp (the "**Licensed Material**").

1.2. It establishes a framework that encourages **free and collaborative use** while ensuring proper attribution and fair remuneration when commercial value is derived from the use of the **FlexUp IP**.

  A binding contractual relationship (the "**Licence**") is automatically formed when a Licensee uses the Licensed Material in accordance with these terms, regardless of whether a separate agreement is signed.

1.3. By accessing or using the Licensed Material, the Licensee enters and agrees to be bound by the provisions applicable to the relevant form of the Licence, depending on the nature and extent of their use.

1.4. The FlexUp Licence reflects FlexUp's commitment to openness, collaboration and fairness.

  It allows free circulation, adaptation and redistribution of the Licensed Material, provided that:
a) Proper attribution to FlexUp is maintained;
b) Redistributions remain free of charge and under equivalent licence terms; and
c) Where commercial benefit is obtained from the use of FlexUp IP, a fair contribution is made to FlexUp in accordance with the principles of the Licence and the subsequent articles.

1.5. While the Licence is automatically binding upon first use of the Licensed Material, Licensees shall endeavour, as soon as possible, to formalise a Licence Special Conditions (**Licence-SC**) that identify the Parties and, in particular when clarity is required regarding commercial terms that may modify or supplement certain provisions of these General Conditions.

### Article 2. Definitions and Interpretation

2.1. Capitalised terms within this Contract are Defined Terms, whose definitions are given in the table below or, if not here, elsewhere in the Contract or in the FlexUp Glossary (available on www.flexup.org/glossary).

2.2. In case of any terminological discrepancies between the documents forming this Contract, the Defined Terms should be interpreted according to the document priority indicated in the Special Conditions. Where no Licence-SC has been executed, the Licence-GC shall prevail.

2.3. The present FlexUp Licence-GC is distributed by FlexUp under the following terms and can be found on the FlexUp website ([[www.flexup.org]{custom-style="Hyperlink"}](http://www.flexup.org))

3.1. **Ownership**

### Article 4. Grant of Licence

4.1. The Licence comes in two forms, depending on the Licensee's effective use of the Licensed Material:

a) **Limited Licence**: The Limited Licence grants the Licensee permission to use the Licensed Material strictly within the scope of Limited Use as defined in Article 5.1. The Limited Licence is automatically formed when a Licensee uses the Licensed Material and is free of charge.
b) **Extended Licence**: The Extended Licence is required to use the Licensed Material for Extended Use as defined in Article 5.2.

4.2. The Extended Licence may be acquired as follows:

a) **Automatic Upgrade Clause**: If the Licensee's use evolves and triggers any of the conditions mentioned in Article 5.2, the Limited Licence automatically converts to an Extended Licence as of the trigger date, and the obligations under Article 8.1 (Fees and Royalties) immediately apply. The Licensee shall notify FlexUp within 30 days of the trigger event.
b) **Manual Upgrade:** You may also request an Extended Licence at any time; such request does not waive any Automatic Upgrade already triggered.

### Article 5. Scope and Tiers of Use

5.1. **Limited Use Licence Scope**

  The Limited Licence grants a Licensee the right to use the Licensed Material for personal or internal purposes only within the limits set out below. Any use not expressly permitted herein falls outside the scope of this Limited Licence:
a) For transactions (i.e., contracts, orders) to which the Licensee is a direct party;
b) To structure or manage a single project or business in which the Licensee holds a key position (e.g., owner, director, majority shareholder);
c) For internal use within a single organization or company, as the Licensee, including use by its officers, employees and authorised agents acting strictly on its behalf. Such use shall not extend to affiliates, subsidiaries, or third parties;
d) For paid professional advisors (such as lawyers, accountants, or consultants) to provide advice related to the Licensed Material **to one (1) single client**, within any continuous twelve (12) month period;
e) For **non-commercial**, personal educational or testing purposes;
f) Republishing, translating, or adapting the Licensed Material for external distribution, provided that such use is non-commercial, includes proper attribution to FlexUp, and remains under the same FlexUp Licence. If any revenue or other financial benefit is generated from such distribution, whether direct or indirect, and regardless of the monetisation mechanism (including but not limited to advertising, sponsorship, paid access, affiliate or referral fees, commissions or donations), it shall be deemed Extended Use pursuant to Article 5.2, and the royalty provisions of shall apply.

5.2. **Extended Use Licence Scope**

  The Extended Use Licence automatically applies to any activity exceeding the Limited Use Licence, including but not limited to:
a) **Multiple Client** **Engagements**: Providing paid professional or consulting services using or referencing the Licensed Material to more than one (1) client within any rolling 12-month period or incorporating the FlexUp Model into paid professional activity;
b) **Public Marketing**: Using the \"FlexUp\" name, logo, or related trademarks in any public-facing materials (such as a website, social media profile, advertisement, etc.) to promote or solicit paid professional services;
c) **Derivative Distribution**: The Licensee translates, modifies, or re-packages the Licensed Material and distributes it (whether free or paid);
d) **Integration**: Integration into tools or systems for third parties.
e) **Monetised Activities**: Any Monetised Activity constitutes Extended Use, except professional advisory to a single client as permitted under Article 5.1.d.
  Extended Use does not automatically imply that a Royalty Fee is due; Royalty is owed only when the Licensee generates Revenue Attributable to FlexUp pursuant to Article 8.

### Article 6. General restrictions

6.1. The following General restrictions are applicable to all licences:

a) Reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to drive the source code, data structures, or algorithms underlying the FlexUp Platform or Model;
b) Create, market, or operate any model, application, or service that is represented, promoted, or passed off as FlexUp, or as being officially endorsed or certified by FlexUp, unless expressly authorised;
c) Remove, alter, or obscure any trademark, logo, copyrights notice, or attribution appearing on or within the Licensed Material;

### Article 7. Extended Licence Obligations

This article applies only to Extended Use Licensees.

7.1. **Audit Rights**

  FlexUp reserves the right to appoint an independent third party bound by confidentiality to audit, on at least 10 days' notice, once per year, the Licensee\'s financial records for the sole purpose to ensure compliance with the terms of this Licence. Audits shall be conducted at FlexUp\'s expense, unless the audit reveals a discrepancy exceeding five percent (5%) in FlexUp\'s favour, in which case the Licensee shall bear the cost of the audit and pay any underpaid royalties plus interest in accordance with the interest provisions under Article 8.3. The audit shall conclude with a written summary of findings shared with the Licensee.

7.2. **Failure to declare Extended Use**

  Failure by the Licensee to declare any Extended Use, or to report and remit royalties within the required timeframe, shall constitute a material breach of this Licence and shall trigger the following consequences:
a) Immediate conversion of the Limited Use Licence to the Extended Use Licence;
b) Payment of all applicable royalties retroactively from the first day of *effective* Extended Use; and
c) Application of a late payment penalty of twenty per cent (20%) on any overdue royalties.

7.3. FlexUp reserves the right to seek compensation for any further losses or damages suffered as a result of such breach, including, without limitation, any loss of commercial opportunity, competitive disadvantage, and harm to its reputation or expenses incurred in connection with the breach or its enforcement.

### Article 8. Payment and Royalties

8.1. **Royalty Fee**

a) In consideration for the rights granted under the Extended Licence, the Licensee shall pay to FlexUp a royalty fee of **ten percent (10%)** of the FlexUp-Based Revenue.
b) FlexUp-Based Revenue includes revenue derived from any professional activity in which the Licensed Material is used, referenced, implemented, or relied upon, even if the Licensed Material represents only a portion of the total value delivered.

8.2. **Reporting and Payment**

a) The Licensee shall provide FlexUp with a quarterly report detailing all gross revenue subject to the Royalty Fee through any means or channels made available by FlexUp, within thirty (30) days of the end of each calendar quarter.
b) Upon receipt of such report, FlexUp shall issue a Proforma Accounting Document to the Licensee. The Licensee agrees to pay the full invoiced amount via bank transfer.
c) If the invoice is received by the Licensee before the 15th of a given month, payment is due at the end of that same month. If the invoice is received after the 15th of a given month, payment is due at the end of the following month.
d) De minimis rule: Where FlexUp-Based Revenue arising from a given activity is less than 1 000 € per calendar quarter, such revenue shall be reported on an annual basis only, and only give rise to a royalty payment if the royalty due is equal or greater to 100 € per calendar year.

8.3. **Late payment**

  In case of failure to pay by the due date, the Licensee shall automatically incur late payment penalties on the overdue amount, without prejudice to FlexUp's other rights or remedies:
a) A fixed charge of ten percent (10%) of the overdue amount plus interest accruing daily at an annual rate of five percent (5%) from the due date until full payment; and
b) If the Licensee still fails to pay within fifteen (15) days after receipt of a written request from FlexUp, then an additional penalty of ten percent (10%) of the overdue amount plus interest accruing daily at an annual rate of ten percent (10%).
c) FlexUp may at its own discretion and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies suspend further provision of services until payment in full is received or terminate this agreement.

### Article 9. Flexibility and Good-Faith Adjustment

9.1. FlexUp recognises that some Licensees, particularly small organisations, independent professionals or early-stage initiatives, may temporarily be unable to sustain the standard royalty rate defined in Article 8. In such cases, FlexUp remains open to discussing alterative arrangements in good faith, with the objective of preserving collaboration and fairness in order to uphold the Parties' mutual interests and long-term viability.

9.2. Licensees who wish to request a deferral or alternative form of contribution shall contact FlexUp within thirty (30) days of the due date of the applicable royalty. Any adjusted term shall be agreed in writing and may be formalised through the Licence-SC.

9.3. This mechanism does not, by any means, waive the Licensee's obligation to report usage but allows both Parties to adapt the financial terms to the Licensee's actual circumstances.

9.4. FlexUp operates on a principle of trust. We believe our users will fairly assess and report their usage. Disputes will be resolved through discussion before any formal proceedings.

### Article 10. Open Source Principles and Obligations

This Licence operates based on principles of fair use and collaborative open-source development, including:

10.1. **Distribution**: Licensees may distribute the Licensed Material (including any Adapted Material) free of charge and under the same terms outlined in this FlexUp Licence.

10.2. **Attribution**: Licensees must attribute FlexUp as the source of the Licensed Material, providing a link to this Licence. Attribution must be made in a reasonable and customary manner, provided that it shall not imply any sponsorship, endorsement or association by FlexUp.

10.6. The Licensee may recover only reasonable and direct costs incurred in duplicating, reproducing, transmitting or hosting the Materials.

Any sums recovered shall reflect cost recovery only and not constitute consideration for intellectual property rights.

10.7. The Licensee may offer for sale or otherwise charge for products or services that use, implement, or incorporate the Materials. Where such activity exceeds the scope of Limited Use, the provisions for Extended Licence and the applicable royalty obligations in Article 8 (Payment and Royalties) shall apply.

11.1. The "**FlexUp**" name, logo and all associated visual identity elements are protected by trademark.

11.2. **Permitted Use** (no authorisation needed)

  Licensees operating under an Extended Licence may reference FlexUp in professional offerings (e.g., "FlexUp-based consulting"), provided such use remains factual and non-misleading.

FlexUp-Based Revenue **includes**, for example:

### 1. **Professional advisory work,** (legal, accounting, tax, consulting, business coaching, finance, strategic planning, etc.) where the advisor uses, reviews, or relies upon the FlexUp App, or any FlexUp template, model, checklist, charter, framework, methodology or any other FlexUp material in the course of delivering work to a client.

### 2. **Administrative, operational or support work,** such as bookkeeping, accounting, corporate finance, governance, data analysis or reporting, where FlexUp tools (e.g., the FlexUp app, dashboards, cost models, process templates, etc.) are used to produce part or all of the deliverable.

### 3. **Deliverables or documents,** partly or fully produced using FlexUp Material (e.g., charters, templates, reports, agreements, visual frameworks, canvases, etc.).

### 4. **Courses, trainings, webinars, workshops, or paid tutorials,** that reference, teach or incorporates FlexUp tools, templates, methodologies or frameworks. This includes online courses, in-person training programs, corporate workshops and paid tutorials.

### 5. **Software, platforms, or dashboards,** that embed or automate any portion of the FlexUp Model.

### 6. **Publications or media,** whose revenue (advertising, sponsorship, paywall access) is linked to content based on FlexUp Material.

FlexUp-Based Revenue **does not include** revenue from activities unrelated to FlexUp.

## Section C. Examples of calculation FlexUp-Based Revenue

### 1. **Example 1** --- Percentage Attribution Within a Consulting Engagement

  - A consultant delivers a project worth **€10,000**. They estimate that portion of the advisory services related to implementing FlexUp account for **20%** of the value provided; the remaining 80% relates to unrelated advisory work (such as market research on the client's products).
  - FlexUp-Based Revenue = 10 000 € × 20% = **2 000**
  - Royalty due = 10% × 2 000 € = **200 €**
- **Example 2** --- Single Client, Multiple Deliverables
  - A legal advisor invoices a client **1 800 €** for corporate structuring advice, 700 € of which is directly based on FlexUp templates, while the rest is bespoke drafting work.
  - FlexUp-Based Revenue = 700 €
  - Royalty due = 10% × 700 € = **70 €**
  - If the quarterly royalty is below 100 €, the **de minimis rule applies** (annual reporting) unless the Advisor exceeds 1 000 € in FlexUp-Based Revenue that quarter.
- **Example 3** --- Training or Workshops
  - A trainer charges **3 000 €** for a one-day workshop. FlexUp material represents approximately half of the course content.
  - FlexUp-Based Revenue = 3 000 € × 50% = **1 500 €**
  - Royalty due = 10% × 1 500 € = **150 €**
